All files required for the CQPLabs Engine Order Telegraph project. 

Updates and further description will be soon found on the [CPQLabs](http://cqplabs.neophilus.net) site.

Web Server
----------

Written in Python, mainly because I'm not a fan of Ruby and the machine this project will ultimately be deployed on already has Python installed for the most part, and I'd be pushing it to insist Haskell was installed on it...

Also, because this is all a learning experience anyway; I thought it may be time to see what this Python doohickey is all about.
